# React Hooks Photo Gallery

Example of a photo gallery built with React Hooks. Please be aware this is just an example, you would want to load images that were optimized for specific screen sizes. The one's in the demo are quite large. 

*If I get some additional time, I will attempt to update this for performance and responsiveness*.

## Use

- `git clone https://github.com/DZuz14/react-hooks-gallery.git`
- `cd react-hooks-gallery`
- `npm i`
- `npm start`

If your browser does not automatically open, visit `http://localhost:8080`

## YouTube

There is a tutorial on how to build this as well. The video was recorded before React Hooks were released and uses a class based component. However, the two versions are nearly almost identical in code except for a few minor changes. 100% worth watching.
